### A. Customer Journey 

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the <code>subscriptions</code> table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

Answer:

````sql
select s.customer_id,
	p.plan_name,
	s.start_date
from subscriptions s
left join plans p on s.plan_id = p.plan_id
where s.customer_id in (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19)
order by s.customer_id
````
