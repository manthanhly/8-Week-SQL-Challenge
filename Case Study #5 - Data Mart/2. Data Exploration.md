### 2. Data Exploration 

**1. What day of the week is used for each <code>week_date</code> value?**

````sql
select distinct
	to_char(dates,'day') as day_of_week
from
	clean_weekly_sales
````
Answer:
| day_of_week |
|-------------|
| monday      |

**2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?**

````sql
select distinct 
	week_number 
from 
	clean_weekly_sales
order by 
	week_number 
````

Answer: 
| week_number |
|-------------|
|      13     |
|      14     |
|      15     |

with total_sales as (
select 
	calendar_year,
	sum(sales) as total_sales
from 
	clean_weekly_sales
group by

-- fidning total sale of each month with each platform
total_sale_demographic as (
select

**8. Which <code>age_band</code>  and <code>demographic</code>  values contribute the most to Retail sales?**

````sql
select 
	age_band,
	demographic,
	sum(sales) as total_sales
from 
	clean_weekly_sales
group by
	age_band,
	demographic 
order by
	sum(sales) desc
limit 1 -- giving the highest total_sales 	
````
***

Answer:
| age_band | demographic | total_sales |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|  unknown |    unknown  | 16338612234 |

**9. Can we use the <code>avg_transaction</code> column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?**

````sql
select 
	calendar_year,
	platform,
	round(avg(avg_transaction),2) as precomputed_average_transaction,
	round(sum(sales)::numeric/sum(transactions),2) as average_transaction
from 
	clean_weekly_sales
group by
	calendar_year,
	platform
order by 
	calendar_year,
	platform 
````
Answers:
| calendar_year | platform | precomputed_average_transaction | average_transaction |
|---------------|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
|          2018 | Retail   |                          42.91 |               36.56 |
|          2018 | Shopify  |                         188.28 |              192.48 |
|          2019 | Retail   |                          41.97 |               36.83 |
|          2019 | Shopify  |                         177.56 |              183.36 |
|          2020 | Retail   |                          40.64 |               36.56 |
|          2020 | Shopify  |                         174.87 |              179.03 |

We can but it depends:
- Precomputed method - Using <code>avg_transaction</code> will provide stability and historical context
- Dynamic method - Using total <code>sales</code> vs total <code>transactions</code> for each year and each platform offers real-time insights. In general, I would use Dynamic method.
