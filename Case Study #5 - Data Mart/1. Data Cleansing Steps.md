### 1. Data Cleansing Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the <code>data_mart</code> schema named <code>clean_weekly_sales</code>:
- Convert the <code>week_date</code> to a <code>DATE</code> format
- Add a <code>week_number</code> as the second column for each <code>week_date</code> value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a <code>month_number</code> with the calendar month for each <code>week_date</code> value as the 3rd column
- Add a <code>calendar_year</code> column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called <code>age_band</code> after the original <code>segment</code> column using the following mapping on the number inside the <code>segment</code> value
- Add a new <code>demographic</code> column using the following mapping for the first letter in the <code>segment</code> values:
- Ensure all <code>null</code> string values with an <code>"unknown"</code> string value in the original <code>segment</code> column as well as the new <code>age_band</code> and <code>demographic</code> columns
- Generate a new <code>avg_transaction</code> column as the <code>sales</code> value divided by <code>transactions</code> rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

````sql

	to_date(week_date, 'dd/mm/yy') as dates,
	extract(week from to_date(week_date, 'dd/mm/yy')) as week_number,  --week_date in wrong format so we have to use to_date
	extract(month from to_date(week_date, 'dd/mm/yy')) as month_number, -- same as above but changed to month 
	extract(year from to_date(week_date, 'dd/mm/yy')) as calendar_year, -- changed to year

	end as age_band,
	case
		when segment like 'C%' then 'Couples'
		when segment like 'F%' then 'Families'
		else 'unknown' 
	end as demographic,
	customer_type,
	transactions,
	round(sales/cast(transactions as decimal),2) as avg_transaction, -- postgre will return integer if we divide integer to integer -> cast 1 number to decimal 
	sales
