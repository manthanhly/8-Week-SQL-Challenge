## Introduction

Danny's latest venture, Data Mart, operates an international online supermarket specializing in fresh produce. In June 2020, Data Mart switched to sustainable packaging across all products. Danny needs help analyzing the impact of this change on sales performance across different platforms, regions, segments, and customer types. This case study aims to quantify the effects, identify the most impacted areas, and explore strategies for minimizing future sales impacts from similar sustainability updates.
