### 3. Before & After Analysis

This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the <code>week_date</code> value of <code>2020-06-15</code> as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all <code>week_date</code> values for <code>2020-06-15</code> as the start of the period after the change and the previous <code>week_date</code> values would be before

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

**1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and afterÂ 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?**

- Find <code>week_number</code> of 2020-06-15. We got 25 as the week number, so 4 weeks before 2020-06-15 is week 21 to 24 and 4 weeks after 2020-06-15 is week 25 to 28. 

````sql
select distinct 
	week_number
from
	clean_weekly_sales
where
	dates = '2020-06-15'
````
Answer: 
| week_number |
|-------------|
|          25 |

- Total sales of 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15

````sql
select 
	sum(sales) as total_sales
from 
	clean_weekly_sales
where
	week_number between 21 and 28 and calendar_year = '2020'
````
Answer:
| total_sales  |
|--------------|
| 4664872526  |

- Reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sale 

````sql
with before_after as (
select 
	sum(case when week_number between 21 and 24 and calendar_year = '2020' then sales
		end) as total_before,
	sum (case when week_number between 25 and 28 and calendar_year = '2020' then sales
		end) as total_after
from 
	clean_weekly_sales
)

select 
	total_after - total_before as total_change,
	round((total_after - total_before)::numeric*100/total_before,2) as percentage 
from
	before_after
````
Answer:
| total_change | percentage |
|--------------|------------|
|    -26884188 |      -1.15 |

**2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?**

- Total sales of 12 weeks before and after 2020-06-15 - that would be from week 13 to 36
````sql
select 
	sum(sales) as total_sales
from 
	clean_weekly_sales
where
	week_number between 13 and 36 and calendar_year = '2020'
````
Answer:
| total_sales  |
|--------------|
| 14100220900  |

- Reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sale 

````sql
with before_after as (
select 
	sum(case when week_number between 13 and 24 and calendar_year = '2020' then sales
		end) as total_before,
	sum (case when week_number between 25 and 36 and calendar_year = '2020' then sales
		end) as total_after
from 
	clean_weekly_sales
)

select 
	total_after - total_before as total_change,
	round((total_after - total_before)::numeric*100/total_before,2) as percentage 
from
	before_after

group by 
	calendar_year
order by
	calendar_year	
````
Answer:
| calendar_year | total_sales  |
|---------------|--------------|
|          2018 |   4254383723 |
