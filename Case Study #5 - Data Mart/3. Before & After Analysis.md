### 3. Before & After Analysis

This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the <code>week_date</code> value of <code>2020-06-15</code> as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all <code>week_date</code> values for <code>2020-06-15</code> as the start of the period after the change and the previous <code>week_date</code> values would be before

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

**1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and afterÂ 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?**

- Find <code>week_number</code> of 2020-06-15. We got 25 as the week number, so 4 weeks before 2020-06-15 is week 21 to 24 and 4 weeks after 2020-06-15 is week 25 to 28. 

````sql
select distinct 
	week_number
from
	clean_weekly_sales
where
	dates = '2020-06-15'
````
Answer: 
| week_number |
|-------------|
|          25 |

- Total sales of 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15

````sql
select 
	sum(sales) as total_sales
from 
	clean_weekly_sales
where
	week_number between 21 and 28 and calendar_year = '2020'
````
Answer:
| total_sales  |
|--------------|
| 4664872526  |

- Total sales of 4 weeks after 2020-06-15

**2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?**


**3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?**
