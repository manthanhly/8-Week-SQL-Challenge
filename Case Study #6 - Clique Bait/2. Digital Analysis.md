from 
	events e
join
	event_identifier ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type 
cross join
	(select count(distinct visit_id) as total_count from events) as total_visits -- cross join to get the total count for all events 
where
	ei.event_name = 'Purchase'

**7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?**

````sql
select

from 
	events e
join
	event_identifier ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type
