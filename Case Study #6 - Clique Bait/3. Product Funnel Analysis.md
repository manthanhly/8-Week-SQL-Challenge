### 3. Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:
-  How many times was each product viewed?
-  How many times was each product added to cart?
-  How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
-  How many times was each product purchased?

````sql
create table individual_products as
with event_status_table as (
select
	e.visit_id,
	ph.product_id,
	ph.page_name,
	ph.product_category,
	max(case when ei.event_name = 'Page View' then 1 else 0 end) as product_viewed, -- Getting status of product viewed or not
	max(case when ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart' then 1 else 0 end) as added_to_cart -- Getting status of product added to cart or not
from 
	events e
join
	event_identifier ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type 
join
	page_hierarchy ph on e.page_id = ph.page_id 
where 
	product_id is not null
group by
	e.visit_id,
	ph.product_id,
	ph.page_name,
	ph.product_category

	distinct visit_id 
from 
	events e
join 
	event_identifier ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type 
where

),

-- final_table CTE used to combine 2 CTEs above in order to get the product purchased status

	event_status_table est
left join
	purchase_table pt on est.visit_id = pt.visit_id 
)

select 
	product_id,
	page_name,
	product_category,
	sum(product_viewed) as total_viewed,
	sum(added_to_cart) as total_added,
	sum(case when added_to_cart = 1 and purchased = 0 then 1 else 0 end) as total_abandoned, -- produced must be added to cart first and then abandoned
	sum(case when added_to_cart = 1 and purchased = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as total_purchased -- 2nd option is to take total_added to cart subtract total_abandoned 
from
	final_table
group by
	product_id,
	page_name,

order by

Answer:
| product_id | page_name      | product_category | total_viewed | total_added | total_abandoned | total_purchased |
|------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
|          1 | Salmon         | Fish             |         1559 |         938 |             227 |             711 |
|          2 | Kingfish       | Fish             |         1559 |         920 |             213 |             707 |
|          3 | Tuna           | Fish             |         1515 |         931 |             234 |             697 |
|          4 | Russian Caviar | Luxury           |         1563 |         946 |             249 |             697 |
|          5 | Black Truffle  | Luxury           |         1469 |         924 |             217 |             707 |
|          6 | Abalone        | Shellfish        |         1525 |         932 |             233 |             699 |
|          7 | Lobster        | Shellfish        |         1547 |         968 |             214 |             754 |
|          8 | Crab           | Shellfish        |         1564 |         949 |             230 |             719 |
|          9 | Oyster         | Shellfish        |         1568 |         943 |             217 |             726 |


Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

**1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?**

***

**2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?**

***

**3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?**

***

**4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?**

***

**5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?**
