## Introduction 

Danny saw a unique opportunity to merge Neo-Banks, cryptocurrency, and data, leading to the creation of Data Bankâ€”a digital-only bank with an advanced distributed data storage platform. Unlike traditional banks, Data Bank offers cloud storage limits based on account balances. As the team aims to expand their customer base and manage data storage needs, this case study focuses on calculating metrics, tracking growth, and analyzing data to forecast and plan for future developments.
